{"name":"Sinatra-recipes","tagline":"Community contributed recipes and techniques","body":"Sinatra Recipes \r\n---------------\r\n\r\nCommunity contributed recipes and techniques for the [Sinatra Web\r\nFramework][sinatra].\r\n\r\n## Why yet another doc project?\r\n\r\nQuite simply, the Sinatra README and Book have become long in the tooth.\r\n\r\nThis project is to extract any redundant and overlap between the two sources,\r\nand create a home for user contributed recipes and documentation to take form.\r\n\r\n## How can I help?\r\n\r\nGot a recipe or tutorial for [Sinatra][sinatra]? Awesome, this is\r\nthe first place you should go if you're looking to contribute.\r\n\r\nOnce you have [forked the project][github-forking] send a [pull\r\nrequest][github-pull-requests], just be sure to follow the [styling\r\nguidelines][style-guidelines]. \r\n\r\nYou can also get a hold of us on [irc][irc] or the [mailinglist][mailinglist].\r\n\r\nDon't have any ideas? Check out the existing [issue tracker][issues] for\r\nrecipes that have been requested or are in progress.\r\n\r\n## Here's the run down\r\n\r\nTo get started you should clone the repository from github:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone git://github.com/sinatra/sinatra-recipes.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow once you `cd` into `sinatra-recipes` you should see a few things.\r\n\r\nFirst you should take note of the application files:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\napp.rb # a tiny application for displaying the contributed recipes\r\nconfig.ru # rackup file for deploying to heroku\r\nGemfile # dependencies file for bundler to run the app\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to run the application yourself first you need the `bundler` gem.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngem install bundler\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are on Rubinius make sure that you have the latest bundler version\r\ninstalled. Versions prior to 1.0.10 won't work.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# then install the application dependencies\r\nbundle install\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce that is complete, you should only need to run `rackup` in the application\r\nroot and visit: [localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292)\r\n\r\nSince the application just maps the flat files, you can browse either the\r\nsource or the web app to view recipes.\r\n\r\nIf you check out the source you will see a few folders listed, in each folder\r\nthere is a `README.md` that will briefly explain the topic. This can also be\r\nview by going to `/p/:topic` where `topic` is the folder you wish to view.\r\n\r\nIn each folder there should be a number of recipes pertaining to each topic.\r\n\r\n## On translations\r\n\r\nCurrently we're not supporting translations in the main repository.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you'd like to maintain a fork for translating the docs then feel\r\nfree to do so, and add your fork to the [list of translations in the\r\nwiki][translations].\r\n\r\n[sinatra]: http://www.sinatrarb.com/\r\n[sinatra-book]: http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra-book\r\n[issues]: https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra-recipes/issues\r\n[style-guidelines]: http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra-recipes/wiki/Style-Guidelines\r\n[translations]: http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra-recipes/wiki/Translations\r\n[irc]: irc://irc.freenode.net/#sinatra\r\n[mailinglist]: http://groups.google.com/group/sinatrarb\r\n[github-forking]: http://help.github.com/forking/\r\n[github-pull-requests]: http://help.github.com/pull-requests/\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
